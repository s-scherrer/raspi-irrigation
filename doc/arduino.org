* Arduino code setup

The code for the arduino can be found in ~arduino_code~. The actual code is in
~arduino_code/sketch_temp_sensor~, and there is an additional zipped library
~arduino_code/cactus_io_AM2302.zip~.

To upload the code to the Arduino, install the Arduino IDE for linux (download
zip file), then do:
1) open the ~sketch_temp_sensor.ino~ file via the GUI
2) import the library (Sketch -> Include Library)
3) select the board from the dropdown menu

If you run into permission error while uploading, try ~sudo chmod a+rw
/dev/ttyACM0~ (or whatever the device name is).
